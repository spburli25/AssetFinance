          <p>Businesses looking for straightforward financing and asset ownership should consider Hire Purchase. You spread the cost of the asset by paying instalments over the agreed term. This is followed by a final one-off purchase option fee transferring asset ownership to you at the end of the term.</p>
          <br/>
          <p> The Benefits of Hire Purchase:</p>
          <ul style = {{listStyleType: "square",paddingLeft:"15px"}}>
            <li><strong>Minimum capital outlay</strong> – costs are spread over the term of the agreement.</li>
            <li><strong>Certainty of costs</strong> – fixed monthly payments assist with budgeting.</li>
            <li><strong>Capital allowances</strong> – your business can claim any available capital allowances.</li>
            <li><strong>VAT</strong> – VAT is not payable on the rentals. VAT relating to the asset purchase price is payable upfront when entering into the Hire Purchase agreement, however this is recoverable.</li>
            <li><strong>Asset ownership</strong> – upon payment of the ‘purchase option fee’ your business will have title to the asset at the end of the term</li>
            <li><strong>Tax reduction</strong> – repayment interest can be offset against profits for taxation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          We can tailor a Hire Purchase solution to suit your business and your budget.

          <p>Finance Leases are ideal for businesses looking for immediate use of a new asset with minimal initial financial outlay. This allows you to use an asset for an agreed term in return for rental payments.</p>
          <br/>
          <p>Benefits of Finance Leases:</p>
          <ul style = {{listStyleType: "square",paddingLeft:"15px"}}>
            <li><strong>Deferred VAT payments</strong> – VAT is paid on your rentals rather than the upfront purchase price, which is paid by Corporate Asset Finance. VAT paid on your rentals is usually recoverable.</li>
            <li><strong>Operation</strong> – your business remains in day-to-day control of the asset.</li>
            <li><strong>Asset use</strong> – full use of the asset with no ownership responsibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum capital outlay</strong> – Corporate Asset Finance will fund up to 100% of the purchase price of the asset and the costs are spread over the lease term.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible</strong> – tailored to suit your business’s needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Tax reduction</strong> – rentals can normally be offset against profits for taxation.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>Businesses looking to minimise the impact of new equipment acquisitions on their cashflow and manage asset risk should consider an Operating Lease.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Corporate Asset Finance will build in a residual value (a guaranteed future value) which will reduce the capital and interest charged during the lease term, reducing your monthly rentals and boosting your cashflow.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Benefits of Operating Leases:</p>
        <ul style = {{listStyleType: "square",paddingLeft:"15px"}}>
          <li><strong>Cashflow</strong> – beneficial cashflow from reduced rentals.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost efficiency and improved profitability</strong> – providing cheaper lending commitments compared to vanilla debt alternatives</li>
          <li><strong>Tax Reduction</strong> – rentals can normally be offset against profits for taxation.</li>
          <li><strong>Security and operational benefits</strong> – you can return the asset at the end of its lease period, making it the ideal choice for project or contract work or those that need to upgrade assets regularly.</li>
          <li><strong>Off balance sheet</strong> – the asset and associated funding can often be treated as off balance sheet.</li>
          <li><strong>Flexibility</strong> – an Operating Lease allows you to return the asset, purchase the asset at the current fair market value or consider a secondary rental agreement, giving your business great flexibility.</li>
        </ul>

        We can tailor a Operating Lease solution to suit your business and your budget.
